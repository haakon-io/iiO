# IiO 1.0.1 - 03/03/2021 - Haakon Hestness - www.haakon.io

This project is a fully functioning Todo application that lets you create a list of tasks and save them, delete individualy and delete all to reset the application.
 It uses Angular Material [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for the form controls. The application uses a service to save the Todos to localStorage but this can easily be modified to point to an actual end point of a service. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
